## 👋 The Story Behind KitesurfOK

Hi, I'm Max, the founder of KitesurfOK. My journey in the world of kitesurfing began in 2011. For several years, I worked as a kitesurf instructor, sharing my passion with others. As I looked for opportunities within the wider kitesurfing industry, I realized finding openings was a challenge – there was no central platform. This inspired me to create KitesurfOK.

This GitHub organization hosts open-source resources and projects designed to support the kitesurfing career community, stemming from that initial mission.
